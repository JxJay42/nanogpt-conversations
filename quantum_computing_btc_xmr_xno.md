it is believed that shor's algorithm, could be used to crack encryptions, because it can be used for quantum computing and computed prime factors.
But if I understand it well, quantum computing results are probabilistic, not deterministic, so the results are approximate. More over, error in quantum system make it difficult to find exact numbers for high bit encryptions.
Is that correct ?

You are largely correct in your understanding of the challenges facing the practical application of Shor's algorithm for breaking encryption. Let's break down the points you raised:

**1. Shor's Algorithm and its Threat to Encryption:**

*   **Correct:** Shor's algorithm, theoretically, poses a significant threat to widely used public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography). These systems rely on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers (RSA) or solving the discrete logarithm problem (ECC).
*   **Correct:** Shor's algorithm, if implemented on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, can solve these problems much faster than the best-known classical algorithms, effectively breaking these encryption methods.

**2. Probabilistic Nature of Quantum Computing:**

*   **Correct:** Quantum computation, including Shor's algorithm, is inherently probabilistic. When you run a quantum algorithm, you get a distribution of possible outcomes, not a single deterministic answer.
*   **Nuance:**  While the output is probabilistic, Shor's algorithm is designed in a way that the correct factors of the number are among the *most probable* outcomes. By running the algorithm multiple times and analyzing the results, you can identify the correct factors with high probability.
*   **Think of it like this:** Imagine a loaded die that lands on the number 6 more often than any other number. If you roll it a few times, you might not get a 6. But if you roll it many times, you're very likely to see the 6 appear frequently, and you can infer that it's the most probable outcome.

**3. Error in Quantum Systems:**

*   **Correct:** Current quantum computers are very susceptible to errors. These errors arise from the delicate nature of maintaining superposition and entanglement, which are crucial for quantum computation. Environmental noise, imperfections in the hardware, and even the act of measurement can introduce errors.
*   **Correct:** For Shor's algorithm to successfully factor large numbers used in modern encryption, a quantum computer would need to be significantly larger (more qubits) and much more error-resistant than what we have today.
*   **Error Correction:** There are active research efforts in *quantum error correction*, which aims to mitigate these errors. However, effective error correction adds significant overhead, requiring many more physical qubits to represent a single "logical qubit" (an error-corrected qubit).

**Summary:**

*   Shor's algorithm is a real theoretical threat to current encryption, but it's not an immediate practical concern.
*   While quantum computation is probabilistic, Shor's algorithm is designed to give the correct answer with high probability after multiple runs.
*   The biggest hurdle is building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer. Current quantum computers are too small and error-prone to run Shor's algorithm for practically relevant key sizes.
*   The field of quantum error correction is crucial to making fault-tolerant quantum computers a reality, but it is a very challenging area of research.
    We are still years or more likely, decades from a quantum computer capable to break the current encryption protocols.

**In essence, your understanding is accurate. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing and the prevalence of errors are significant challenges that need to be overcome before Shor's algorithm can be used to break real-world encryption.**

Is my understanding correct, that the recent attempts to create a quantum computing chip, with entangled photon gateways, could be the best for future challenges of scale quantum computing to levels needed for practical uses for cracking encryption ?

Using entangled photon gateways for quantum computing is a promising approach, but it's not definitively "the best" yet.  It's one of several competing technologies, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  It's too early to declare a clear winner in the race to build large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Here's a breakdown of why photonic quantum computing is attractive and what challenges it faces regarding scalability and cracking encryption:

**Advantages of Photonic Quantum Computing:**

* **Room temperature operation:** Photons are less susceptible to environmental noise than some other qubit implementations (like superconducting qubits), potentially simplifying the hardware requirements.
* **Low decoherence:** Photons maintain their quantum states for relatively long times, which is important for performing complex computations.
* **Integrability with existing fiber optic technology:** This could simplify integration with classical communication networks.
* **Fast gate speeds:** Photonic gates can operate very quickly.

**Challenges for Photonic Quantum Computing and Cracking Encryption:**

* **Scalability:** While progress is being made, building large-scale photonic quantum computers with thousands or millions of qubits (needed for cracking encryption) is still a significant challenge. Creating and manipulating large numbers of entangled photons reliably is difficult.
* **Photon Loss:** Photons can be lost during transmission or interaction, which introduces errors into the computation.
* **Two-qubit gates:**  Implementing high-fidelity two-qubit gates (essential for universal quantum computation) is technically demanding in photonic systems.  While there has been progress using probabilistic gates, the overhead associated with them still represents a challenge for scaling up.
* **Fault tolerance:**  Like all quantum computing platforms, photonic systems need robust error correction schemes to handle the inevitable errors that occur during computation.  While error correction methods for photonic qubits exist, integrating them into large-scale architectures is an ongoing research area.

**Other Competing Technologies:**

It's important to remember that photonic quantum computing is not the only game in town.  Other promising technologies include:

* **Superconducting qubits:** Currently the most advanced in terms of qubit number and coherence times. Companies like IBM, Google, and Rigetti are pursuing this technology.
* **Trapped ions:** Offer very high-fidelity gates and long coherence times. Companies like IonQ and Honeywell are developing trapped-ion quantum computers.
* **Neutral atoms:**  Similar to trapped ions, but use neutral atoms instead, offering some potential advantages in scalability.
* **Topological qubits:**  Theoretically very robust against errors, but their experimental realization is still in its early stages.  Microsoft is heavily invested in this approach.


**In conclusion:**

Entangled photon gateways and photonic quantum computing are a promising area of research with the potential for significant advancements.  However, significant challenges related to scalability, error correction, and two-qubit gate fidelity remain.  It's too early to definitively say whether this approach will ultimately be "the best" for cracking encryption or other quantum computing applications.  The future of quantum computing is likely to involve a combination of different technologies, and the field is constantly evolving.

You're asking a complex question about the intersection of cryptography, cryptocurrency, and the hypothetical future threat of powerful quantum computers. Let's break it down:

**Parts of Cryptocurrencies Where Cryptography is Used:**

Cryptocurrencies rely heavily on cryptography for their core functionality. Here are the main areas:

1. **Digital Signatures:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used to verify the authenticity of transactions. Each user has a private key (kept secret) and a public key (shared). The private key is used to sign transactions, and anyone can use the corresponding public key to verify the signature.
    *   **Algorithm:** Most commonly ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).
    *   **Quantum Vulnerability:** Shor's algorithm can break ECDSA, making it possible to forge signatures and create fraudulent transactions.

2. **Hashing:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used in various parts, including:
        *   **Proof-of-Work (PoW):**  Miners solve complex hash-based puzzles to add new blocks to the blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin).
        *   **Creating addresses:** Public keys are often hashed to create shorter, more manageable addresses.
        *   **Merkle Trees:** Used to efficiently summarize all transactions in a block.
    *   **Algorithm:**  SHA-256 (Bitcoin), CryptoNight or other variations (Monero), Blake2b (Nano).
    *   **Quantum Vulnerability:** Hash functions are generally considered *resistant* to Shor's algorithm, but they are vulnerable to Grover's algorithm, another quantum algorithm. Grover's algorithm can speed up brute-force attacks, but it requires a quadratic speedup, making it less of a threat than Shor's algorithm. For example, a 256-bit key would still offer 128 bits of security against Grover, making a brute force attack unpractical.
        But for proof of work, it means that quantum computer has advantage of square root of computing power.

3. **Address Generation (Public Key Cryptography):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Deriving a user's public key (and subsequently, address) from their private key.
    *   **Algorithm:** Typically involves elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
    *   **Quantum Vulnerability:**  Vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, as it relies on the same mathematical problems as digital signatures.

4. **Privacy-Enhancing Features (in some cryptocurrencies):**
    *   **Purpose:**  To obfuscate transaction details, such as sender, receiver, and amount.
    *   **Algorithms:**  Vary widely, including:
        *   **Ring Signatures:**  (Monero) Allow a user to sign a transaction as part of a group, making it difficult to identify the actual signer.
        *   **Stealth Addresses:** (Monero) One-time addresses that hide the recipient's public address.
        *   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** (e.g., Zcash) Allow a user to prove that a transaction is valid without revealing any details about it.
    *   **Quantum Vulnerability:**  Depends on the specific implementation. Some privacy features may be more resistant to quantum attacks than others. Current implementations of Ring Signatures and Stealth addresses are still based on ECC or variations of it, and are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm.

**Vulnerabilities in Practice (Assuming Quantum Computers Capable of Running Shor's Algorithm):**

If a nation-state had access to a quantum computer capable of breaking ECC, here's how it could impact cryptocurrencies:

1. **Transaction Forgery:** They could forge transactions by breaking digital signatures. They could spend someone else's coins by creating transactions signed with their private key.
2. **Double Spending:** They could spend the same coins multiple times by quickly creating conflicting transactions and using their quantum computer to mine blocks containing their preferred transactions. While hashing would take advantage of Grover's algorithm and only get square root advantage, the advantage would be enough to be able to create longer chain of blocks, then the rest of the network, so it would be accepted as valid chain.
3. **Compromising Addresses:** They could derive the private key from a public key, giving them full control over the associated funds.
4. **Breaking Privacy Features (potentially):** The specific impact on privacy features would depend on their design and implementation. In many cases, like with Monero, they also rely on vulnerable elliptic curve cryptography.

**Vulnerability Status of BTC, XMR, and XNO (Hypothetical Quantum Threat):**

Let's analyze each cryptocurrency under this hypothetical scenario:

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):**
    *   **Signatures:** ECDSA - **Vulnerable.**
    *   **Hashing:** SHA-256 - **Resistant to Shor's, but weakened by Grover's.**
    *   **Addresses:**  Derived from ECDSA public keys - **Vulnerable.**
    *   **Practical Vulnerability:** High. An attacker could forge transactions, steal funds, and potentially cause a collapse of confidence in the system. They could target large wallets where the public key has been exposed in a transaction. Even reusing addresses become a vulnerability. Funds in addresses whose public keys are not exposed would be relatively safe until a transaction is made using the same address.
2. **Monero (XMR):**
    *   **Signatures:** Ring Signatures (based on ECC) - **Vulnerable.**
    *   **Hashing:** CryptoNight variant (designed to be ASIC-resistant) - **Resistant to Shor's, but weakened by Grover's.**
    *   **Addresses:** Stealth Addresses (based on ECC) - **Vulnerable.**
    *   **Practical Vulnerability:** High, despite its privacy features. While Monero's privacy features make it harder to track transactions, they don't protect it from a quantum attack. An attacker could still potentially forge transactions or compromise addresses, and the privacy features would be broken if the underlying cryptography is compromised.
3. **Nano (XNO):**
    *   **Signatures:**  Uses a modified version of EdDSA, which uses curve Ed25519. The algorithm could be stronger than ECDSA, but it is still based on ECC, which is vulnerable to Shor's algorithm.
    *   **Hashing:** Blake2b - **Resistant to Shor's, but weakened by Grover's.**
    *   **Addresses:** Derived from Ed25519 public keys - **Vulnerable.**
    *   **Practical Vulnerability:** High. An attacker could forge transactions, steal funds, and undermine the integrity of the network, same as with BTC and XMR.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **This is a hypothetical scenario:** We don't yet have quantum computers powerful enough to break current cryptographic standards.
*   **Post-Quantum Cryptography:** The development of quantum-resistant algorithms is an active area of research. Cryptocurrencies could potentially migrate to these new algorithms in the future. For example, there are lattice-based cryptographic methods in development.
*   **Other Attack Vectors:**  Even without quantum computers, cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to other types of attacks, such as 51% attacks, software bugs, and social engineering.

**In conclusion, if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer existed today, Bitcoin, Monero, and Nano, in their current forms, would be highly vulnerable. Their reliance on elliptic curve cryptography for digital signatures and address generation makes them susceptible to Shor's algorithm. The development and implementation of post-quantum cryptography are crucial for the long-term security of cryptocurrencies.**

What would be the minimal theoretical qubit size of the computer, for each of these parts, for each of the listed cryptocurrencies, to be practicaly vulnerable in the real world?

## Assistant

Estimating the exact number of qubits needed to break cryptocurrency cryptography is complex and depends on several factors, including:

* **Algorithm specifics:**  The precise implementation of the cryptographic algorithms used in each cryptocurrency.
* **Error correction overhead:** The number of physical qubits needed to represent a single logical, error-corrected qubit.  This overhead can be significant, often requiring thousands of physical qubits per logical qubit.
* **Qubit quality and coherence time:**  The stability and reliability of the qubits.
* **Optimization of Shor's algorithm implementation:** Algorithmic improvements and specific hardware implementations can influence the required qubit counts.

However, we can provide some rough estimates based on current research and assuming fault-tolerant quantum computation:

**1. Breaking ECDSA (Signatures and Addresses - BTC, XMR, and XNO):**

*   RSA Conference estimates suggest that breaking a 256-bit elliptic curve key (like those used in ECDSA) would require roughly 2330 logical qubits using Shor's algorithm.  
*   Given the overhead of error correction, the number of *physical* qubits required would likely be in the millions, possibly tens of millions.

**2. Breaking Hashing (PoW - BTC, XMR, and XNO):**

*   While Grover's algorithm could speed up brute-force attacks on hash functions, it doesn't provide as dramatic a speedup as Shor's algorithm.  
*   For SHA-256 (Bitcoin), Grover's algorithm effectively reduces the security level from 256 bits to 128 bits.  This is still considered very secure.
*   For CryptoNight (Monero) and Blake2b (Nano), with similar key sizes the security reduction is also similar, being still considered very secure.
*   The qubit requirements for Grover's algorithm are lower than for Shor's algorithm, but a useful speedup would still require hundreds to thousands of logical qubits, and many more physical qubits.

**3. Breaking Other Privacy Features (XMR):**

*   The qubit requirements for breaking privacy features like ring signatures and stealth addresses in Monero, depend on their specific implementation and the size of the anonymity set.  Rough estimates are likely similar to those for breaking ECDSA, meaning thousands of logical qubits and millions of physical qubits.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **These estimates are constantly evolving:** As quantum computing technology advances and new algorithms are developed, these estimates may change.
*   **Logical vs. Physical Qubits:** The distinction between logical and physical qubits is crucial.  Logical qubits are the error-corrected qubits that perform the actual computation, whereas physical qubits are the underlying hardware components.
*   **Focus on Logical Qubits:**  When comparing different quantum computing platforms, the number of logical qubits is a more relevant metric than the number of physical qubits.


**In summary:**

Breaking the ECC used in all three currencies (BTC, XMR, XNO) for signatures and address generation would require thousands of logical qubits (millions of physical qubits).  While Grover's algorithm could weaken the hashing used in PoW, it wouldn't completely break it, and the required quantum computer would still be very large and very far from current technology.  Breaking the privacy features of Monero would likely require a similarly large quantum computer as breaking ECC.

It's important to stay updated on the latest developments in both quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography, as these estimates might rapidly evolve in the next decade.

What would be practical changes for these crypto currencies, to mitigate the future risks in each of these parts. I suppose, that changing the hitsorical ledger is imposiible or impractical, but what other measures can be taken ?

## Assistant

You're right, retroactively changing the historical ledger of a cryptocurrency to make it quantum-resistant is generally considered impossible or impractical. It would require a hard fork that would likely not be accepted by the entire community, leading to a split in the chain and a loss of consensus.

However, there are practical changes that cryptocurrencies can implement to mitigate the future risks posed by quantum computers. These changes primarily involve transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and implementing strategies to handle the legacy, non-quantum-resistant parts of the blockchain.

Here are some potential measures for each part:

**1. Digital Signatures:**

*   **Transition to Post-Quantum Signatures:**
    *   **Fork to a new signature scheme:** This is the most crucial step. Cryptocurrencies can hard fork to implement a new, quantum-resistant digital signature algorithm. Examples include:
        *   **Lattice-based:**  Dilithium, Falcon
        *   **Hash-based:**  SPHINCS+
        *   **Code-based:**  McEliece
        *   **Multivariate:**  Rainbow
    *   **New transactions would use the new scheme.**
    *   **Challenges:** Choosing the right algorithm, ensuring community consensus for the fork, and dealing with the transition period.

**2. Hashing:**

*   **Increase Hash Output Size:**  While hash functions are resistant to Shor's algorithm, they are weakened by Grover's algorithm. Increasing the output size of the hash function (e.g., from SHA-256 to SHA-512) can provide a higher level of security against Grover's.
*   **Consider Quantum-Resistant Hash Functions:** While not strictly necessary, some cryptocurrencies might consider adopting hash functions specifically designed to be resistant to quantum attacks, although there's less urgency for this compared to signatures.

**3. Address Generation:**

*   **Post-Quantum Key Derivation:** Similar to signatures, the method for deriving public keys and addresses from private keys needs to be updated to a quantum-resistant scheme, which will most likely be the same algorithm chosen for digital signatures.
*   **One-Time Addresses:** Encouraging or mandating the use of one-time addresses can help mitigate the risk to funds in old, unspent outputs. Since the public key is only revealed when a transaction is made, funds in addresses that have never been used are protected until a transaction is made from that address.

**4. Privacy-Enhancing Features:**

*   **Evaluate and Update:** The specific privacy features in cryptocurrencies like Monero will need to be carefully evaluated for their quantum resistance. This might involve:
    *   **Updating underlying cryptographic primitives:** Replacing ECC-based components with quantum-resistant alternatives.
    *   **Developing new privacy-preserving techniques:** Researching and implementing new privacy mechanisms that are inherently quantum-resistant.

**Strategies for Dealing with the Legacy (Non-Quantum-Resistant) Part of the Blockchain:**

*   **Soft Fork for Flagging:** A soft fork could be implemented to flag addresses that have revealed their public keys (by making a transaction) and are therefore vulnerable. This would alert users to the risk and encourage them to move their funds to new, quantum-safe addresses.
*   **Time-Locked Transfers:**  A mechanism could be introduced to allow users to "lock" their funds in old addresses and schedule a transfer to a new, quantum-safe address at a future date. This would give users time to transition their funds before a quantum attack becomes feasible.
*   **Quantum-Safe Address Enforcement (Hard Fork):** After a certain period, a hard fork could be implemented to make transactions from old, vulnerable addresses invalid. This would force users to move their funds to quantum-safe addresses if they haven't already.

**Specific Considerations for BTC, XMR, and XNO:**

*   **Bitcoin (BTC):** The most urgent change for Bitcoin is transitioning to a post-quantum signature scheme. Bitcoin's relatively simple design might make it easier to implement some changes compared to more complex cryptocurrencies, however the large value of old unmoved coins, and the uncertainty about the status of Satoshi Nakamoto's coins, could make consensus harder.
*   **Monero (XMR):** Monero will need to update the cryptographic primitives underlying its privacy features (ring signatures, stealth addresses) to quantum-resistant alternatives. This could be a more complex undertaking than Bitcoin's changes.
*   **Nano (XNO):** Nano, like Bitcoin, primarily needs to transition to a post-quantum signature scheme.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

*   **Community Consensus:**  Any major change to a cryptocurrency requires consensus among the community (developers, miners, users). Achieving consensus on such significant changes can be challenging.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choosing the right post-quantum algorithms is crucial. These algorithms are still relatively new and need thorough vetting before being deployed in a live cryptocurrency.
*   **Development and Testing:** Implementing these changes requires significant development effort and rigorous testing to ensure security and avoid introducing new vulnerabilities.

**Conclusion:**

While retroactively changing the blockchain is impractical, cryptocurrencies can take several steps to mitigate the future risks posed by quantum computers. The most important step is transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms for signatures and address generation. Dealing with the legacy part of the blockchain requires careful planning and community coordination. The transition to post-quantum cryptography is a necessary step for the long-term survival of cryptocurrencies in a world with powerful quantum computers.
